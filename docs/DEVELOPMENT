 This document describes how to develop Backup.

 - vtsbackup_test.yml is a test configuration file for development.
 - tests/ folder contains some test for special cases.

 ## Run tests

 We have a `Makefile` provided some commands:

 - `make test` run unit test.
 - `make test:all` run all tests, this will execute test for `tests/` folder.

 ## Guide for adding a new storage

 - Add a new storage in `storages/` folder, you can follow the `storages/gcs.go` as an example.
     - If the storage is a AWS S3 compatible storage, you can use `storages/s3.go` as a base.
 - Add a new test file in `tests/` folder, you can follow the `tests/minio.yml` as an example.
     - Don't put your credentials in the test file, you can use environment variables to pass them.
